       <h2>Customer Discrimination in the Field: Supporters’ Right-Wing Political Attitudes and Ethnic Team Composition in German Professional Soccer</h2>
       <p>This paper analyzes the link between revealed customer preferences and ethnic team composition in German professional soccer. We operationalize ethnic team composition based on players' external appearance using facial recognition techniques, based on players' names, and based on players' nationality. Based on the assumption that individual customer preferences markedly changed after a series of events on New Year’s Eve 2015-16 and are also reflected in subsequent voting behavior, we apply a twofold empirical strategy: A difference-in-differences approach shows that third-division teams, with a stronger focus on local catchment areas and regional fan communities, increased the share of native players after New Year’s Eve 2015-16 by 6.3 to 10 percent (in comparison to first and second division teams); and regression results indicate that a one standard deviation increase in regional voting shares of the right-wing populist party AfD in the 2017 federal elections is associated with an increase in the share of native players by 1.9 to 2.6 percentage points. To also address the question of whether these findings are driven by the management's approach to adjust ethnic team composition to consumer preferences or rather reflect anticipated discrimination on behalf of non-native players, we furthermore assess the impact of changes in ethnic team composition on economic success and team productivity.<br>

       <h2>On gender and excessive risk-taking in tournaments: evidence from freediving competitions</h2>
       <p>This study examines self-chosen risk levels, performances, and adverse health effects in a real-life tournament. Our settings are international freediving competitions where semi-professional athletes dive without support up to 130 metres deep in open sea. We investigate how different athletes, differentiated by ability and gender, trade off the tournament incentives against the costs of excessive risk-taking and present two key results. First, male divers respond more strongly to the tournament incentives than female divers in the sense that there is a stronger link between diver ability and performance in male competitions. This suggests that the tournament incentives work better on men. Second, however, male divers fail their targets more often, are more often disqualified, and pass out more often, suggesting that the tournaments trigger more excessive risk-taking in men.<br>
